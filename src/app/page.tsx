            As a Financial Analyst, I have completed financial modeling for over
            50 companies across three major sectors in my country, including
            refineries. Over the past four years, I dedicated myself to this
            role, often working extra unpaid hours, progressing from an
            untrained beginner to leading the financial team at one of my
            country's most established and reputable brokerage and fund
            institution. Originally a Biomedical Engineering major, my curiosity
            led me to add an Economics minor and make a career pivot into
            finance. This path has inspired me to pursue advanced studies in the
            UK, where I look forward to entering the global finance job market
            with a strong work ethic, curiosity, and analytical
            rigourâ€”especially in technical sectors that demand precision and
            insight.
