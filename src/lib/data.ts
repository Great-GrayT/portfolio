Located in the Middle East on a 232-hectare site along the ArakâTehran road, it is recognized as the first producer of aluminum ingots in Iran. In 1972, the company commenced operations with two production lines and an annual capacity of 45,000 tons. With the increasing domestic demand for aluminum, Arak and other cities in Markazi Province became recognized as the hub of Iranâs aluminum industry. After the Islamic Revolution and the departure of American experts, the company expanded its production lines from two to five by 1991, raising annual capacity to 120,000 tons. In 2002, given the importance of energy consumption in the aluminum industry, construction began on a new 110,000-ton unit with 200 kA technology, meeting environmental standards, adjacent to the existing plant. Today, Iran Aluminum Company operates with two technologiesâ70 kA and 200 kAâwith a combined annual production capacity of 177,500 tons, producing a variety of aluminum ingots in different alloys from molten metal generated in both the new and old smelting workshops.",
