export const personalStatement = `As a Financial Analyst, I have completed financial modeling for over 50 companies across three major sectors in my country, including refineries. Over the past four years, I dedicated myself to this role, often working extra unpaid hours, progressing from an untrained beginner to leading the financial team at one of my country's most established and reputable brokerage and fund institution. Originally a Biomedical Engineering major, my curiosity led me to add an Economics minor and make a career pivot into finance. This path has inspired me to pursue advanced studies in the UK, where I look forward to entering the global finance job market with a strong work ethic, curiosity, and analytical rigourâ€”especially in technical sectors that demand precision and insight.`;
